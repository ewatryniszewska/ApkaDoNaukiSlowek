## Setup
This project has no binary release avaliable yet.

I recommend using Android Studio IDE for development 
purposes. Clone the repository. Open the folder in the 
IDE. Select the `Nexus_5X_API_30_x86` configuration and
run the application.

## Usage
This application is very easy to use.

When the application is launched you see the main screen
with words. This is the default learning mode. You can
scroll through the words and read them.
Now, whenever you are ready, select one of the tenses
from the top list. You just switched to the testing
mode. The selected tense is now hidden. Fill blank
places with the correct forms. Press "TEST" button to
check your work. All correct answers are going to be
colored green, opposite to the wrong red one.
Get back to the learning mode by clicking the "RESET"
button.
